# Multi-Layered-Web-Map-Application

This is a web map designed to show two unique sets of data:
- [World population data](#world_population)
- [Data of volcanoes in the US](#volcano_data)

The specific data shown is determined by a control panel that the user can use to switch between the data


## World Populations

Each country is color coded according to where their population lies in the following range:
- 游릴Green: Under 10 million
- 游릳Yellow: Between 10 million and 50 million
- 游릲Orange: Between 50 million and 100 million
